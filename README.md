# Loan Prediction Project

This project is centered around using a random forest model to predict loan approvals. It involves downloading and processing data from Azure Blob Storage, and leveraging the power of pandas and machine learning for prediction analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Installing

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-prediction-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd loan_score
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the project:
1. Execute the main script in the root folder:
    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```

This will start the process of data retrieval, cleaning, and prediction. The output will be your predicted loan approvals.
